**Zero-Bot** is an open-source social platform built on a single, uncompromising premise: **No Bots. Just People.**

In an era where AI generates 90% of internet traffic, Zero-Bot guarantees that every interaction is authentic. We achieve this through cryptographic **Proof of Personhood (PoP)** verification, ensuring 1 person = 1 account, without compromising privacy.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Human-Only Feed**: Every post and comment is signed by a verified human execution trace.
-   **Proof of Personhood**: Zero-knowledge biometric verification (simulated for prototype).
-   **Deep Space Aesthetic**: A premium, "Deep Space" dark mode designed for focus and immersion.
-   **Community Governance**: User-driven moderation and community creation.
-   **Privacy First**: No real names required. Use handles, but verify your humanity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
